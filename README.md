## About Me
- My name is Katherine Shine, and I'm a recent Advertising graduate of the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. My time at the CJC introduced me to alot of the more technical sides of design and visual theory, which I also enhanced with a minor in Digital Arts and Sciences. 
- In my free time I work as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. Some of my hobbies include archery, jewelry-making, video games, writing, watching horror movies, and surfing Pinterest for craft and cooking inspiration. 

## Past Coding Experience
- I learned rudementary HTML and CSS back in my sophomore year of high school, as well as some light JavaScript. In that course I learned how to make a very skeletal website and a basic side-scrolling platformer game (with the help of Code.org). 
- In my time as an undergrad, I took a game design course as a part of my minor, which exposed me to some heavier coding elements in the Unity engine, though it was mostly manipulating sets of scripts to fit the needs of our game.
- This class is my official dive back into the web design world of coding, and I'm very excited to refresh my memory and push it further!

## Career Goals
1.  My ultimate career aspiration is to work as a creative or art director at an advertising agency, and getting the chance to take the reigns of the visual identity of creative advertising campaigns.
2. Working as a concept artist for media such as video games or films would also be a dream come true.
3. Marketing researcher is also a position which I'd aspire to reach, as I greatly enjoy looking into the finer details of how and why things work the way they do. Fun fact, this is also the driving force of why I got interested in computers and coding at an early age.
